# HPSI - Happy Potter Space Invaders

A quick game made by a team of 3 using Godot during a day-long workshop! 

The game is inspired by Space Invaders, and themed around Harry Potter. The idea of casting spells at Dementors is not that bad, if you ask me! Except that we did not have time to look for a proper spell sprite, so Harry is shooting tiny versions of himself instead. Isn't that more fun? :D

## What was achieved during the workshop

- The player (Harry) can fly freely around the screen and cast spells.
- Spells are dynamically instantiated at the player's position and move away from the player horizontally until they collide with an enemy.
- Enemies are dynamically generated at game launch to create several instances of the same enemy scene/node - this will allow to decide how many enemies we want in the scene.
- Once generated, enemies move slowly towards the player.
- A spell colliding with an enemy will cause the enemy to die and will remove that instance of a spell.
- The player colliding with an enemy will cause both the enemy and the player to die. _(Brooms fly at very high speeds!!)_
- Sound effects will play when casting spells and when killing enemies.
- The sound effect played when enemies die will have a randomised pitch to make it less repetitive and make it sound better when several sounds overlap.
